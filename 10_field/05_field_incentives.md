# Field Incentives

*Owner: Sales Operations / Field Leadership*

## The Incentive Problem

**Current State:** Field has no financial incentive to prioritize Apps.

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Apps attach rate in comp | ❌ Not included |
| Influenced revenue recognition | ❌ Not tracked |
| Apps-specific SPIFs | ❌ None |
| Apps opportunity tracking | ⚠️ Partial |

**Result:** Field focuses on core products; Apps is de-prioritized.

## Why Incentives Matter

```mermaid

    subgraph Problem["WITHOUT INCENTIVES"]
        P1[Apps deprioritized]
        P2[No signal from field]
        P3[Missed opportunities]
        P4[Slow adoption]
    end
    
    subgraph Solution["WITH INCENTIVES"]
        S1[Apps prioritized]
        S2[Signal captured]
        S3[Opportunities identified]
        S4[Faster adoption]
    end
    
    P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    S1 --> S2 --> S3 --> S4
```

## Incentive Framework

### Tier 1: Recognition (Low Cost, Immediate Impact)

| Mechanism | Description | Owner |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Apps Champion Program** | Public recognition for Apps wins | AA |
| **Win Story Spotlight** | Feature Apps wins in newsletters | AA |
| **Leaderboard** | Track Apps opportunities by FE | Sales Ops |
| **Exec Shout-outs** | VP/SVP recognition for strategic wins | FE Leadership |

### Tier 2: Development (Medium Cost, Medium-term)

| Mechanism | Description | Owner |
|-----------|-------------|-------|

### Tier 3: Financial (Higher Cost, Longer-term)

## Signal Capture Incentives

**Problem:** We need field to provide meaningful feedback on Apps opportunities, blockers, and product gaps.

### Incentives for Signal Capture

| Signal Type | Incentive | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Opportunity Identification** | Apps Champion points | Track in SFDC |
| **Product Gap Reporting** | Recognition in PM feedback | Weekly summary |
| **Loss Analysis** | No penalty; constructive feedback | Safe environment |
| **Use Case Documentation** | Featured in playbooks | Named attribution |
| **Customer Quotes** | Case study credit | Marketing recognition |

### Making Signal Capture Easy

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too much effort | Simplified SFDC fields |
| No feedback loop | Weekly signal summary to field |
| No visible impact | "Your feedback influenced X feature" |
| Time pressure | 5-minute signal capture form |

## Influence Strategy for Comp Changes

Since comp plan changes require executive buy-in and Finance approval, here's the influence path:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Phase1["PHASE 1: PROVE VALUE (M1-6)"]
        P1A[Document strategic wins]
        P1B[Track attach rate manually]
        P1C[Quantify influenced revenue]
    end
    
    subgraph Phase2["PHASE 2: SOCIALIZE (M6-9)"]
        P2A[Present data to FE leadership]
        P2B[Propose comp change concept]
        P2C[Get Finance input]
    end
    
    subgraph Phase3["PHASE 3: IMPLEMENT (M9-12)"]
        P3A[Pilot SPIFs with 1 vertical]
        P3B[Measure impact]
        P3C[Propose FY27 comp inclusion]
    end
    
    Phase1 --> Phase2 --> Phase3
```
