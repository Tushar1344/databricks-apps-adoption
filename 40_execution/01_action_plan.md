## Hypothesis-Action Connection

| Phase | Primary Hypotheses Tested | Decision Point |
|-------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **P1 (M1-3)** | H3 (Full-Funnel GTM), H6 (Metrics Align), H8 (Motions) | Month 3: Enablement working? BU buy-in? |
| **P2 (M4-6)** | H1 (Tip of Spear), H4 (Archetypes), H7 (Net-New), H8 | Month 6: Attach improving? Archetypes hold? |
| **P3 (M7-12)** | H2 (Moat), H5 (SI vs FDE) | Month 9: Moat real? SI working? |
