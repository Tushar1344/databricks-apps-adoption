# Deliverables Gap Analysis

*Parking lot for deliverables that need to be added to the action plan.*

**Status:** Analysis complete, awaiting prioritization and integration into action plan.

---

## Summary

The playbook **identifies gaps well** but many **don't have concrete deliverables attached** or the deliverables **aren't placed in the action plan phases**.

This document captures the missing deliverables for future planning.

## Why This Matters

### Connection to "Play" Feedback

The head of adoption architecture noted that a "play" requires:
1. **Target accounts** ← We have criteria, need actual named list
2. **Levers/actions** ← We have frameworks, need operational cards/cheat sheets
3. **Burndown tracking** ← Missing entirely

These missing deliverables represent the **operational layer** between strategy and execution.

### Current State

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Strategy** (why, what, how to measure) | ✅ Complete |
| **Frameworks** (hypotheses, traceability, archetypes) | ✅ Complete |
| **Deliverables** (operational artifacts) | ⚠️ Partially defined, not all in action plan |
| **Plays** (named accounts + actions + burndown) | ❌ Not created |

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize** which deliverables to add to action plan
2. **Assign owners** for each deliverable
3. **Create burndown tracker** for deliverable completion
4. **Integrate** high-priority deliverables into Phase 1 action plan
